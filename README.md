# Hello-World
just a tutorial project

Hi all,
I am Gang from China, unemployed. I lost my last job in 2013. I was born in 1968 and I am no longer young. But I am still interested in linux software and web-development. I feel so easy that I am no longer working on garbages just for living and having so much free time to do something I am interested in.
